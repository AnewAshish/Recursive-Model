# Recursive-Model
This code is the recursive model of the parameters that are derived from least square technique (LST). For any regression model, the use of LST is a powerful yet simple tool to determine the relationship (or parameters) between the known and unknown parameters. It may be required to update these parameters whenever new observation is acquired; which is why we need a recursive model. 
At start of run, the program asks for data to add in the repository. These values are added into the database (stored in .txt file)) then the parameters considering the new data is calculated.
